  return <h2>Buying a home is one of the most significant purchases you will make in your lifetime. Before investing your hard-earned money, it is important to understand the market around you. In a diverse country like USA, itâ€™s really hard to make a decision where you should plan to buy a house. When it comes to buy a new house, we all consider pricing, diversity, population, demographics, and school districts. We all want to have an overview of market and demographics of the area we are interested in buying a house. Although there are several web portals to find house listings not all of them support market and demographic analytical dashboards. Home search 365 is a web application which can help you to find your home and give you all the answers at one place.</h2>;
